5. We aim the weapon in the direction of the sight (Pitch)
6. Added crouching and weapon with jump (LeftCtrl - crouch) 
7. Implementing logic of logic for finding and moving to a point on the map for NPC in AiController (Not BehaviourTree!) // This is the logic behind the early version of the engine (UE4 4.19 in 2018)
8. The NPC moves to a fire, tree, and other random point
9. Added implementation of a rifle shot (LMB - shoot)
