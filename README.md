# ThirdPersonShooter
Pattern (Game) for correct class inheritance

1. Correct placement and preparation of the object for further work (in Content, there is a Starter Content folder. She is not needed)
2. Adding animations to the project
3. Adding SM_G36C-SF to the character's arms and behind the character's back (Switch pose with key 1)
4. Adding Ironsights animation and aiming function along with sprint (Right Mouse Button - aiming, LeftShift - sprint)
5. We aim the weapon in the direction of the sight (Pitch)
